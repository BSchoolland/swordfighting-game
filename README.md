## Loads of AI support
A prime goal of this project was to familiarize myself with the limits of today's AI tools.  As such I used AI wherever possible, and probably wrote less than 5% of the code myself.  I also used Suno AI to generate the music.  This process sped up development significantly, and the whole game was made in about 2 days.
